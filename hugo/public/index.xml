&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-lifelong-learner&#34;&gt;A lifelong learner&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a &amp;ldquo;mind-reading&amp;rdquo; full-stack web developer, a lifelong learner, a giver and an amateur comic
artist. I have a great passion for web development and strong belief in the value of the combination
 of working hard and working smart. I believe that if we work hard in a smart-right-way, we could
 achieve more and better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-ambitious-developer&#34;&gt;An ambitious developer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With many years working in web industry as a professional consultant, I have experienced in many
aspects of web development including consultant, design, development and project management or team
leading. I see every day as a chance to learn new thing to fulfill my knowledge so I keep learning
from everybody and everything that I could reach, and I primarily focus on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agile development&lt;/strong&gt;: I believe that Agile will become one of the most important parts in software
development. It&amp;rsquo;s not only about delivering good quality software product but also how we could
adapt real world problems better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productivity improvement&lt;/strong&gt;: I always update myself with new technologies, new working methodologies
then practicing them in my side-projects or freelancer ones. So I could find out what&amp;rsquo;s working for
me, what could help me improving my productivity and share them to everybody, even it&amp;rsquo;s a tiny
coding trick or a big change in mindset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficient human interaction&lt;/strong&gt;: I strongly believe that everybody could do great things with the
right tools in the right way. So if we could collaborate &amp;amp; guide people efficiently, it would bring the
huge impact to not only projects but also with company culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beside of that, I&amp;rsquo;m also interested in many interesting topics, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychology&lt;/em&gt; Reading or RnD about stuff that effect/related to Productivity, Reducing procrastinations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Human Development&lt;/em&gt;: How to live a healthy life, maintain a good relationship, Self-improvement, Personal Branding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Products/Projects Management&lt;/em&gt; with effectiveness, lean and smart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All aspect of &lt;em&gt;software development&lt;/em&gt; like Architecture design, Backend, Frontend, SysOps, Quality Assurance, UI/UX &amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-young-entrepreneur&#34;&gt;A young entrepreneur&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What we know is a drop of water. What we do not know is an ocean.&amp;rdquo; is my favorite quote that I
learned when I was 12. It always reminds me of being an everyday learner, and I&amp;rsquo;m always looking
forward to challenging myself for non-stop improving and advancing my career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-a-simple-man&#34;&gt;And a simple man&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above of all, I&amp;rsquo;m just a simple-happy-man who has a warm family with my beautiful wife and my lovely
daughter. And my hobbies are pretty geeky: Gaming, Reading or playing around with Open-source projects&lt;/p&gt;
