I have great passion for Agile software development and firm belief in value from the combination of working hard and working smart.I believe that if we truly work hard in a smart-right-way, we could achieve far better results.</p><p>&ldquo;What we know is a drop of water. What we do not know is an ocean.&rdquo; is my favorite quote that I learned when I was 12 & still reminds me of being an everyday learner. I&rsquo;m always looking forward to challenging myself for non-stop improving and advancing my professional.</p><h2 id=an-ambitious-developer>An ambitious developer</h2><p>Starting with the web industry via various roles, I have experienced in not only many aspects of software development but also in multiple industries like e-commerce, prop-tech, insure-tech, blockchain & digital transformation. I see every day as a chance to learn new things to fulfill my knowledge, from everybody and everything that I could reach. My focus on development are not limited with Product & Engineering Team but also with People & Organisation.</p><p>Currently, I&rsquo;m focusing on:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Agile development</strong>: I&rsquo;ve first learned about Agile in 2012 via practising Scrum then since 2014, I&rsquo;ve believed that Agility would become one of the essential aspects for the success of not just software development but also development of People, Teams & Organizations. It&rsquo;s not only about stable with outcomes-oriented but also how better we could navigate & adapt to real-world problems, in VUCA/TUNA era. As well said, &ldquo;Agile is eating the world&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p><strong>Efficiency & Effectiveness</strong>: I&rsquo;ve obsessed with continuous improvement, therefore I always update myself with new technologies, a new way of working&mldr; then validating their practices in personal & professional. So-on, I could find out what&rsquo;s working for me & others around me, even it&rsquo;s a tiny coding trick, a new tool for noting, or a significant change in mindset.</p></li><li><p><strong>People (or Individuals & Interactions)</strong>: I have a strongly belief that everybody could do great things with the right tools in the right way. So if we could find a way to collaborate & guide people efficiently, then to help develop every one is better themselves, it would bring up better impact to not just individuals, but whole organization & anywhere those better ones be a part of it.</p></li></ul><h2 id=and-after-all-im-just-a-simple-guy>And after all, I&rsquo;m just a simple guy</h2><p>After all, I&rsquo;m just a simple-easy-to-please guy who has a warm family with my beautiful wife and my lovely kids. In my free time, you gonna see me gaming, reading or playing around with Open-source projects</p></div></section><section id=tag-pane class="row meta"></section><section id=menu-pane class="row menu text-center"><h4 class=text-center><a class=menu-item href=https://chuquangtu.com>Go back home</a></h4></section><footer class="row text-center footer"><hr><h6 class="text-center copyright">© 2021 - Tu Chu</h6><h6 class="text-center powered">Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></h6></footer></div><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=false;if(!doNotTrack){(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');ga('create','UA-66148185-1','auto');ga('send','pageview');}</script><script src=js/main.js></script></body></html>
