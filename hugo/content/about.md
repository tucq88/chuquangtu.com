## A lifelong learner
I am a “mind-reading” builder/leader with entrepreneur mindset, a go-giving leader plus a life-long learner. I have great passion for Agile software development and firm belief in value from the combination of working hard and working smart.I believe that if we truly work hard in a smart-right-way, we could achieve far better results.

"What we know is a drop of water. What we do not know is an ocean." is my favorite quote that I learned when I was 12 & still reminds me of being an everyday learner. I'm always looking forward to challenging myself for non-stop improving and advancing my professional.

## An ambitious developer
Starting with the web industry via various roles, I have experienced in not only many aspects of software development but also in multiple industries like e-commerce, prop-tech, insure-tech, blockchain & digital transformation. I see every day as a chance to learn new things to fulfill my knowledge, from everybody and everything that I could reach. My focus on development are not limited with Product & Engineering Team but also with People & Organisation.

Currently, I'm focusing on:

- **Agile development**: I've first learned about Agile in 2012 via practising Scrum then since 2014, I've believed that Agility would become one of the essential aspects for the success of not just software development but also development of People, Teams & Organizations. It's not only about stable with outcomes-oriented but also how better we could navigate & adapt to real-world problems, in VUCA/TUNA era. As well said, "Agile is eating the world".

- **Efficiency & Effectiveness**: I've obsessed with continuous improvement, therefore I always update myself with new technologies, a new way of working... then validating their practices in personal & professional. So-on, I could find out what's working for me & others around me, even it's a tiny coding trick, a new tool for noting, or a significant change in mindset.

- **People (or Individuals & Interactions)**: I have a strongly belief that everybody could do great things with the right tools in the right way. So if we could find a way to collaborate & guide people efficiently, then to help develop every one is better themselves, it would bring up better impact to not just individuals, but whole organization & anywhere those better ones be a part of it.

## And after all, I'm just a simple guy
After all, I'm just a simple-easy-to-please guy who has a warm family with my beautiful wife and my lovely kids. In my free time, you gonna see me gaming, reading or playing around with Open-source projects
